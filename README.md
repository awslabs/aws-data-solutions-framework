# Data Solutions Framework on AWS

Data Solutions Framework (DSF) on AWS  is a framework for implementation and delivery of data solutions with built-in AWS best practices. DSF is an abstraction atop AWS services based on [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (CDK) [L3 constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html), packaged as a library.

You can leverage DSF to implement your data platform in weeks rather than in months.

- DSF is available in TypeScript and Python.
- Use the framework to build your data solutions instead of building cloud infrastructure from scratch.
- Compose data solutions using integrated building blocks via Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Benefit from smart defaults and built-in AWS best practices.
- Customize or extend according to your requirements.
