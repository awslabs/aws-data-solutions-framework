# AWS Data Solutions Framework

![ADSF logo](website/static/img/adsf-logo-light.png)

AWS Data Solutions Framework (AWS DSF) is a framework for implementation and delivery of analytics solutions with built-in AWS best practices. AWS DSF is an abstraction atop AWS services based on [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (CDK) [L3 constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html), packaged as a library.

You can leverage AWS DSF to implement your data platform in weeks rather than in months.

- AWS DSF is available in TypeScript and Python.
- Use the framework to build your data solutions instead of building cloud infrastructure from scratch.
- Compose data solutions using integrated building blocks via Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Benefit from smart defaults and built-in AWS best practices.
- Customize or extend according to your requirements.
