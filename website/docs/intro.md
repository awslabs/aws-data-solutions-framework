# Introduction

## Framework 

AWS Data Solutions Framework (AWS DSF), is an open-source framework that simplifies implementation and delivery of integrated, customizable, and ready-to-deploy solutions that address the most common data analytics requirements. AWS DSF framework is an abstraction atop AWS services based on [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) L3 [constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html). 

We designed AWS CDK L3 constructs to provide common building blocks for analytics solutions with AWS best-practices. For example, we provide a construct that creates a complete data lake storage with three different Amazon S3 buckets, encryption, data lifecycle policies, and etc. This means that you can create a data lake with in your CDK application with just a few lines of code. 

You can use AWS DSF to accelerate building your analytics solutions, and/or you can use solutions that've built with it.

## Solutions

We have built a few solutions using AWS DSF that are ready to deploy! You can explore available solutions and deploy to implement your data platform requirements in hours rather than in months. Solutions are fully reusable, composable, and customizable.
