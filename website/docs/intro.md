# Introduction

AWS Data Solutions Framework (AWS DSF), is an open-source framework that simplifies implementation and delivery of integrated, customizable, and ready-to-deploy solutions that address the most common data analytics requirements. With AWS DSF, you can deploy solutions (with built-in AWS best practices) to implement your data platform requirements in hours rather than in months when building using AWS services. Solutions are built with AWS DSF framework to allow for the high level of re-usability, composability, and customization. 

AWS DSF framework is an abstraction atop AWS services based on AWS CDK L3 constructs. You can use AWS DSF to build your analytics solution.
